Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive project for predicting the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using Logistics Regression.

Key Components:

    Jupyter Notebook (ipynb): The core of the project, this notebook guides you through the entire workflow, including:

    Data loading and preprocessing from the provided database (ensure confidentiality)

    Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify potential relationships between features and CVD.

    Feature engineering (if needed) to create new features that might improve model performance.

    Model training and evaluation using Logistics Regression and EDA.

    Performance metrics and visualization to assess model accuracy and effectiveness.
